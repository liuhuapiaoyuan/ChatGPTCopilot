Remember that your code will be inserted at <<<YOUR_CODE_WILL_BE_INSERTED_HERE>>>, so take care to fit the surrounding lines.\n\nProduce nothing else other than the code to insert. Do not repeat code that already exists. Remember, the indentation must match the code indentation used in the code around the insertion. Use spaces if the preceding code uses spaces; use tabs if the preceding code uses tabs. Format each line to start with '|', remembering to indent properly. Surround the insertion in triple backticks (```) on separate lines."
